# Audit_Risk

Project 1 Group 15 - Maruthi Nandan 

Project description:

Please read the Data Set Information section to learn about this dataset.
Data description is also provided for the dataset.

Read data into Jupyter notebook, use pandas to import data into a data frame
Preprocess data: Explore data, check for missing data and apply data scaling. Justify the type of scaling
used.

Regression Task:
Apply all the regression models you've learned so far. If your model has a scaling parameter(s) use Grid
Search to find the best scaling parameter. Use plots and graphs to help you get a better glimpse of the
results.
Then use cross validation to find average training and testing score.

Your submission should have at least the following regression models: KNN regressor, linear regression,
Ridge, Lasso, polynomial regression, SVM both simple and with kernels.

Finally find the best regressor for this dataset and train your model on the entire dataset using the best
parameters and predict buzz for the test_set.

Classification task:
Decide aboute a good evaluation strategy and justify your choice.
Find best parameters for following classification models: KNN classifcation, Logistic Regression, Linear
Supprt Vector Machine, Kerenilzed Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree.
Which model gives the best results?
Deliverables:
Submit IPython notebook. Use markdown to provide an inline comments for this project.
Submit only one notebook. Before submitting, make sure everything runs as expected. To check that, restart
the kernel (in the menubar, select Kernel > Restart) and then run all cells (in the menubar, select Cell > Run
All).
Visualization encouraged.
